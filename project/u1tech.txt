Ultima 1- The First Age of Darkness
Technical File- Revision 2 5/2/95
Written by: Plaid Dragon (joepran@telerama.lm.com)

The newest version of this file is always availible from my homepage:
http://www.lm.com/~joepran/ultima.html

Note from the author- This is one of three hint files for Ultima 1. This file 
is called the tech file and should be U1TECH.TXT. The other two are the 
walkthrough and the hint files, U1WALK.TXT and U1HINT.TXT. If you are stuck, 
I highly recommend the hint file first as it deals with general Q&A. If you 
are still stuck (besides sending whatever is your question to Plaid Dragon for 
possible addition to the respective files), you should consult the 
walkthrough. This file is where you would look for general info, such as shop 
lists and prices and other such information. Oh yea, and I stuck the credits 
and revision history here too. Nyah.

Another note- This document will be in a state of flux until every detail is
hammered down (Rabbit Ears). I will alphabetize the towns and caves later. The 
missing section is incomplete as I'm not sure I've gotten everything. I'll add 
it in a day or so.

Section 1: Creating a Character
1.1 The Races

me if you know. I can't seem to find a difference.
