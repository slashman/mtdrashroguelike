Introduction 
------------- 

DrashRL is a roguelike game in which you play the role of the avatar 
on his quest to escape the deadly arena of the garrintroots. On your 
quest you will face horrible monsters and find magic relics and 
artifacts.

The History So Far...
----------------------

The battle with evil wizard Mondain the Wicked was long and hard; the 
final showdown in the bounds of time and space barely left you 
energies to keep on foot. Still, the gem was shattered, and peace 
returned to Sorsaria. 

With your vanishing breath, you headed to the Time Machine... the time 
to rest was close, you were going back home, having fulfilled the
strange call which brought you to this world of magic and sorcery... 

You boarded the machine and activated the four crystals; the ancient 
device turned on, the door closed shut, and the feeling of being 
stretched and swallowed inside the current of time and space got into 
yourself...

Then, all of a sudden, a green flash lit all the cockpit... a wicked 
smile boomed around and the crystals shattered; the device seemed to 
crack appart. The last thing you saw was a relieving, it was Sorsaria, 
high above the clouds, not your place but better than drifting away 
forever in the void. 

You passed out...

It has been a month since that happened. Now you are imprisoned inside
a cell, not medieval, not modern, an alien, strange looking cell. 

Finally, today, you start to realize what this was all about. 

Your cell door opens and in the floor lies a gauntlet with room for 
two gems. 

You see yourself for a last time in a giant screen, you stare at all
sort of strange devices, installed all around the place.

Then the voice... coming from all places and no place... 

'Ladies and Gentlemen! The champion of sorsaria, vanquisher of Mondain 
the wicked! I give you the Stranger from another world! Fight and win 
your freedom in this, the Garrintrots arena!'

You hear a choir of spectators, you are the game, your blood will 
stain the floor and they will laugh, your sword will cut through 
monsters and they will cellebrate, may be they will watch you die, and 
another one will come. This is what fate had for you, there is no way 
back.

your character defining his stats and skills.
